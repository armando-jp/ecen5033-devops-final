Project Guidance:
* Can be any project of your choosing.
* Can be done solo or in groups of 2.
* Presentations will be after fall break
* 1/2 half class for each individual/team.
* Writeups and zip of all material due date/time of final exam (which, we won't have a final exam).

Either
* Demonstrate a more complex application (e.g., multiple microservices) with a full, end-to-end lifecycle.  i.e., source code in github, changes trigger upgrades, fully monitored, making changes, etc.  (some of this we didn't cover).  Expectation is a demo of the application and lifecycle in class.  

* Create a presentation and tutorial on something we didn't cover in class.  This could be a tool, some capability of K8s we didn't cover, or possibly something else.

* Propose your own project (would not suggest this unless really clear idea already)
